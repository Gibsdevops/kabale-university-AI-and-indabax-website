Explanation of Key Directories/Files:
indabax_kabale/ (Outer Project Folder): This is the root of your Django project. It contains manage.py and the main project configuration folder.

indabax_kabale/ (Inner Project Folder): This folder holds the core settings and the root URL configuration for your entire Django project.

settings.py: Defines database connections, installed applications, static/media file locations, and other global configurations.

urls.py: This is the master URL file that includes URL patterns from your individual apps.

kuai_club/ and indabax_app/: These are individual Django applications. Each app is designed to handle a specific set of features or content (e.g., kuai_club for core club info, indabax_app for IndabaX specific content like tutorials/leaders).

migrations/: Stores database migration files that Django uses to track and apply changes to your database schema.

static/: Contains static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images that are part of the app itself. Each app's static files are namespaced (e.g., kuai_club/static/kuai_club/).

templates/: Stores the HTML template files for rendering web pages. Templates are also namespaced (e.g., kuai_club/templates/kuai_club/).

models.py: Defines the database tables (models) and their relationships for the app.

views.py: Contains the logic that processes web requests, interacts with models, and renders appropriate templates.

urls.py: Defines URL patterns specific to the app, which are then included in the project's root urls.py.

admin.py: Configures how the app's models are displayed and managed in the Django administration interface.

media/: This directory is where user-uploaded content (like profile pictures, event photos, etc.) is stored.

staticfiles/: This directory is created when you run python manage.py collectstatic. It's where all static files from all your apps and Django's admin are collected into a single location, ready for serving in a production environment.

db.sqlite3: The default SQLite database file used during development.

manage.py: A command-line utility that lets you interact with your Django project (e.g., runserver, makemigrations, migrate, collectstatic).

Pipfile, Pipfile.lock: Files used by Pipenv for managing project dependencies, ensuring consistent environments.
